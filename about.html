        <h2>Soft but fierce, just like womanhood.</h2>
        <p><strong>Eir and Wild wellness</strong> was created to combine my previously separate offerings of 'Fitness with Lara' and 'Baby. Body. Beautiful.' into a single empowering yet supportive space for the whole of the womanhood journey.</p>
        
        <h3>The Meaning Behind the Name</h3>
        <p><strong>Eir</strong> [pronounced Air] is a Norse healing and mercy goddess, symbolising healing, protection and care with a powerful feminine energy. Something I always want to provide during my sessions.</p>
        <p><strong>Wild</strong> is freedom to be yourself, not tied by societal pressure, and an untamed spirit. Together they provide a soft but fierce energy just like womanhood and motherhood.</p>

        <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
        <p>If you have been to any of my classes before, you will know that there is never any talk of size, shape or body image. After all, there is so much more to fitness than fitting in a single box for society. Mental and physical health, enjoyment of moving your body and socialising with other women on their journey are just to name a few!</p>
        <p>So if you are looking for a safe, empowering, non-judgemental, motivating, supportive, friendly space for your womanhood journey, then Eir and Wild wellness is for you.</p>
